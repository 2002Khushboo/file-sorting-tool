# Current Limitations (V1)

- Requires USB debugging enabled
- Android-only (iOS not supported)
- Date metadata may fall back to current date for some files
- No duplicate detection yet
- No UI progress indication (CLI only)

These limitations are intentional for V1 and will be addressed in future versions.
